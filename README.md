A "background music" app that allows businesses to easily curate the workplace mood with music in multiple locations using built-in and imported playlists

## Motivation
For many businesses, setting the right mood is very important. Choosing the right music can have a huge impact on customer experience. Yet store managers and owners often leave the music-choosing to whichever employees are working at the time.

This can be a risky proposition, especially in highly optimized environments like clothing stores and supermarkets. To try to maintain an appropriate musical environment conducive to commerce, employees often spend valuable on-the-clock time selecting and changing music to try to maintain an appropriate environment (guilty as charged!).

Why not automate your playlists on a schedule instead?
